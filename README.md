The database that I made is a kind of order terminal in fast food stores with burgers. Indeed, the user will connect, then will be able to choose the burger of his choice, as well as the number he wants to order and finally if he wants to add additional toppings. Once the order has been placed, he will still be able to edit it or delete it if it no longer suits him. All these burgers are available in the administrator menu, where it is also possible to delete or modify the orders. In addition, each order has its number, which allows you to find your way around and differentiate them all.
Some features are not yet operational, but most of the work has been done. The main problem remaining would be the display of orders.
